Kill proxy redirect:
Proxy -> Options -> Add Listener-> Create listener for port with redirect to same port

virtual host routing (might cause page redirect due to recognized host):
Proxy -> Intercept -> change host to FQDN -> Forward

filetype masking trick (for images):
copy "magic bytes" from image file -> place filedata after magic bytes -> change filename to have filetype in it -> Repeater request

URL encoding:
Press Ctrl + U to URL encode request body

token analysis:
- Intercept login request, then right-click and select 'send to sequencer'
- let sequencer collect some tokens and then analyze tokens for changes or patterns

Request manipulation:
Intercept request -> right-click -> send to intruder -> change payload type to target manipulation -> start attack -> check results for varying length where login might be successful
