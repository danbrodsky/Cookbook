Basic privilege escalation discovery:

Library call hijacking:

- find file that executes with root privileges
- run gdb <file-name> and step through until instruction found that makes system call, then 'x/s <mem-location>' from a memory location stated before the sys call
- find the system command from above using 'which <command>'
- create an executable bash file (echo "#!/bin/sh" >> <command>;echo "/bin/sh" >> <command>; chmod +x <command>)
- 'export PATH = <current-dir> : $PATH' to set current directory as highest priority for looking for executables when running commands
- run the root file and a root shell should open
