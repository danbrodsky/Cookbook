Global Offset Table (.got):
    - table of offsets for external symbols

Procedure Linked Table (.plt):
    - stubs to look up addresses in GOT (.got.plt)
    - if address not found then tells linker to look up address

GOT for PLT (.got.plt):
    - addresses stored from .plt lookup

PLT for GOT (.plt.got):
    - jumps to first entry of GOT
    - not used, more for consistency

<function>@plt:
    - linker for this function to its actual body
    - contains a function pointer to this function's location in linked libraries
    - function pointer can be overwritten to change function to any address

<function>@got (function.got):
    - function pointer to address of function within library
    - changes based on address at which library is loaded into address space
    - address of function in library can be obtained by viewing value of function pointer at runtime

Executable Linkable Format (ELF):
    - file header defines whether to use 32 or 64-bit
    - program header defines how to create process image
    - can read ELF headers with "readelf -h <filename>"
